  <h3><b>Environmental building engineer</b></h3>
  <p>As an environmental building engineer I have interest and experience in indoor comfort, daylight and energy evaluations as well as parametric design. I visualize the information which is inherent but not visible in a building.
  <h3><b>Recent graduate</b></h3>
  <p>Yes, I am a recent graduate with master degree in Energy-efficient and environmental building design from Engineering Faculty at Lund University in Sweden.
  <h3><b>Architecture + Code</b></h3>
  <p>Parallel to my masterâ€™s degree I have completed a course in Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard University, which helped me to discover potential of parametric design. Since then I have become an everyday user of Grasshopper and its environmental plugins. A combination of parametric and environemntal building design is the area of my greatest interest.

  <h3><b>Agile attitude</b></h3>
  <p>I am a Pole who studied in Sweden while living and working in Copenhagen. I am well trained in crossing borders.
  <br/>
  <p>When not simulating and modelling buildings, I am a sailor. I have competed in number of regattas and crossed Atlantic ocean. Sailing tought me appreciating simple, functional solutions, but also how to collaborate with nature in a humble and optimal way. I know how important it is to make quick analysis of situation and be constantly prepared for new scenarios.
  <h3><b>Ultimate aim</b></h3>
  <p>My goal is to work with an engaged team on challenging, full of meaning and purpose projects.
