    Optimization of NZEB buildings, modelling occupant behaviour, interaction between building and users.
    Design optimization of a buildings cluster located in Shoukanghang residential area in Shanghai. The main goal of this project was to develop a model able to accurately describe the energy requirements of the buildings and establish a numerical method in order to achieve effective energy-saving measures, through a multi-objective optimization of the envelopesâ€™ performance. Moreover, the analyses focus on the interaction between oc- cupancy behaviour and energy consumption, highlighting how daily habits of Chineese families could effect annual energy use. The presence of person inside a room is noticeable since a body releases heat when its temperature is higher than the ambient air tempera- ture. As a consequence, the energy required to maintain a comfortable indoor climate

      varies according to the number of occupants. Hereby, to get a realistic indication of the role of the occupancy, different types of activities and profiles were developed and further combined with various apartment types. By means of energy simulation software Design- Builder, it was possible to determine the performance of existing project for the optimiza- tion process. Hereafter, the reference model was simulated using the developed occupan- cy schedules in order to define the influence of users behaviour on energy consuption. Shanghai, 2015
