  <h3>City under the bridge</h3>

    Kliniczna Interchange - area dominated by junction of conrete viaducts, train and tram railways - constructed in the early 70s. On the other hand: “That anonymous, seemingly deserted, transition point located in the industrial landscape of the city is intriguing. It attracts attention. Being in a hurry to historical shipyard of Gdańsk this is the place which people pass each morning. In that point roads of the Kliniczna Interchange are crossing with tram lines under the concrete pillars. The place stands out with its inner energy.”

        My thesis was to create a public space simply accessible for all, a democratic character with as few compromises as possible. In other words to redesign the pedestrian area of Kliniczna Interchange. The idea was to achieve it by topography and use it to form a public pedestrian trough. The trough allows smooth movement of pedestrians, cyclists and disabled

        under high viaducts and railway embankments. By creating a shape and a topography of trough and its surrounding I tried to answer cauple of crucial questions in that area: <br>
        1. How to physically connect points of interests on the area borders e.g Hospital, Railway Station, residential areas, Universities, Student Campus, opera, cinema complex?
        2. How to do it without reconstructing the junction, but saving the character of a place?<br>
        3. How to make it easy to use, safe and inteteresting for pedestrians?
