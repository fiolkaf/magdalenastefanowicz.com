  <h3>Passive House 11°50°</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
        The architectural form concept of Passive House 11°50° comes as a result of a para- metric study, strongly influenced by the impact of local climate conditions of the project site, located in Gunnesbo, Sweden.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project was prepared during a course of Integrating Thermal and Moisture Issues within 1st semester of Energy Efficient and Enviornmental Building Design master programme at Lund University.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rowhouses have been designed, simulated and analyzed by team of 3 students: architect (Magdalena Stefanowicz), energy efficient engineer (Roman Lechner) and environmental engineer (Amanda O’Donnel).
