  <h4>Optimization of Helsingborg’s concert hall with regards to nZEB balancing</h4>
  <div>
    <p>
      Helsingborg’s concert house is a landmark of modernistic architecture in Sweden, de- signed by renowned architect Sven Markelius and constructed in 1932. This project exposes the building’s current energy balance and evaluates possible energy reduction solutions and potential to maximize on-site solar production in order to approach an annual net- zero energy building balance. Results show a potential to decrease the energy demand
      of the building by 71% and provide 91% coverage of annual electrical demand with solar technology.

      All measures are assessed with reverential regard to the building’s prominent national and cultural heritage value. Profitability and economic discrepancies for all measures are continuously assessed.
